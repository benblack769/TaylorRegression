Build: Build the solution file in visual studio.

### Description

This is an old project of mine, dating back to a calculus project in high school, long before I learned how to use git.

I wasn't really aware of linear algebra at this point in my life, so I figured it out all by myself.

Honestly, I have failed to find an actual use for this.
